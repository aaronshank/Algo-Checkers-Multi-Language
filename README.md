# This will be a repository of different testing methods for writing algorithms that I come across.

## Each folder will have it's own README.md explaining the maths behind the algorithm.

## Will be written in C# / Java / JavaScript for practicing purposes, I might add other languages for practice later.
* JavaScript will be written using ES6 arrow functions for practicing purposes.
